# Conway's Game of Life built in Rust + WebAssembly

Basically, I followed the [rustwasm tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/) and tweak it a bit for fun.

### Built

You will need cargo and npm installed.

Simply run `make` to build and install deps. Run `make run` to execute a live server (check logs for url).
